Review of Foundational Linear Algebra Topics

The purpose of this repository is to setup a self review for linear algebra topics that come up quite consistentaly in Quantitative Finance. Some things may be more applicable and others may be further stretched out. The ovaraching goal is to make this a good place to reference back to in the future when certain topics come up and a review of material is needed. 

This will be updated over time as time and I update my Notes further. Each sections will contain Some notes reviewing fundamental concepts in addition to a Juptyer Notebook with more applicable Examples showcasing how the to apply this code practically in Python. 

The material taken to compose these notes comes from 

EDX: Numerical Linear Algebra from Foundations to Frontiers
FE Press: Linear Algebra for Financial Engineering by Stefanica 
Matrix Computation by Golub
