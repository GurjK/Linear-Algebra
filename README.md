# Linear-Algebra
Review of Foundational Linear Algebra Topics

The purpose of this repository is to set up a self-review for linear algebra topics that come up quite consistently in Quantitative Finance. Some things may be more applicable, and others may be further stretched out. The overarching goal is to make this a good place to refer to in the future when certain topics come up and a review of material is needed. 

This will be updated over time as I update my Notes further. Each section will contain some notes reviewing fundamental concepts in addition to a Juptyer Notebook with more applicable Examples showcasing how to apply this code practically in Python.
