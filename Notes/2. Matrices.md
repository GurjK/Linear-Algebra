## Linear Transformations

Linear transformations are functions that maps a vector in one vector space to another vector in another vector space. This is only true if the following two are obeyed:

$$
T(x+u) = T(x) + T(u)
$$
and 

$$
T(cu) = cT(u)
$$
where T = Function, c = scalar, and u, v are vectors. As long as these properties hold the function T can be defined as a **Linear Transformation** which takes a vector from $R^n$ to $R^m$. The matrix A represents this transformation on a vector u as follows. 

$$
T(u) = Mu
$$
Where M is a matrix and u is a vector. To understand how M is a matrix we need to look into how M is really a linear transformation and how it can be represented as the set of unit basic vectors. 

## Matrices

A matrix is a set of elements combined together in a rectangular array. The size of the matrix is described by its dimensions, m rows x n columns. A matrix for our purposes can represent a linear transformation such as a rotation or scaling in vector spaces. 

A matrix's vector column can be decomposed into its unit basis vector. For example. The matrix below

$$
M =
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2\\ 
3 & 4\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
If we take the first column of M it can be decomposed as a transformation that is applied to the first unit basis vector, 
$$e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 \\ 
0\\ 
\end{bmatrix}$$
This can be seen if we apply the following Matrix- Vector Multiplication

$$
Me_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2\\ 
3 & 4\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 
1 \\ 
0\\ 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1*1 + 2*0\\ 
3*1+4*0\\ 
\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 
1 \\ 
3\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Now if we remember that we defined a matrix is a linear transformation then we can see that it stretches the $e_1$ unit vector but now if we also want to see the second unit basic vector $e_2$ it would be 
$$
Me_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2\\ 
3 & 4\\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 
0 \\ 
1\\ 
\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 
1*0 + 2*1\\ 
3*0+4*1\\ 
\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 
2 \\ 
4\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This now shows how the unit basis vectors are transformed in this example. Now if we think about a vector we can visualize how it can be written as the components of the unit basis vector. If we have 

$$
v = \begin{bmatrix} 
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
then it can be decomposed as follows

$$
v =  v_1e_1 + v_2e_2
$$
Now if we apply the transformation defined by M to this we can see that this holds true

$$
Mv = v_1Me_1 +v_2Me_2
$$
Each column of M describes how the corresponding unit basis vector is transformed. It changes the direction and magnitudes of the unit basis vectors. Then these transformed basis vectors are a new transformation or coordinate system. This can then be applied to a vector v by scaling or transforming it representing or creating a linear transformation. 

Another example of a linear transformation that is more specific is a rotation through an angle $\theta$. A linear transformation of a vector  in $R^2$ can be described through this matrix. When $\theta$ = 0 we get the standard unit basis vectors as follows. 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta & -sin\theta \\
sin\theta & cos\theta
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Matrix - Matrix Multiplication

Now that we have understood what a Matrix - Vector Multiplication means, a linear transformation then we can interpret that a Matrix - Matrix multiplication as a linear transformation being applied to a linear transformation. If the resulting vector of a matrix multiplication  AB = M then M was applied to a vector then MA would represent applying the linear transformation B first then A second to the vector v.

On of the important rules as stated in earlier notes is that if 

A = m x n matrix and B = n x m matrix then 

AB = m x m matrix 
BA = n x n matrix

The columns of the first matrix must equal the rows of the second matrix for matrix-matrix multiplication to be possible.

> 	$$ c_{22} = 3 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 8 = 18 + 32 = 50. $$

### Properties of Matrices

- $ (AB)C = A(BC) $ (Associative property of matrix multiplication)
- $ AB \neq BA $ (Matrix multiplication is not commutative in general)
- $ A(B+C) = AB + AC $ (Distributive property)
