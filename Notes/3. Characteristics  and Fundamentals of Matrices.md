Before getting into the in depth study of different matrices it is important to look into and understand the different things that we are considered with  in relation to the properties of a matrix

## Vector Space

The vector space of a matrix is all vectors obtained from matrix-vector multiplications and the existence of a zero vector

For a set V to be a vector space then the following must hold true:
	- if u,v $\in$ V, then u + v $\in$ V
	- if v $\in$ V and c is a scalar then cV $\in$ V
	- There exists a 0 vector such that v + 0 $\in$ v

Typical examples of a vector space are:
- $R^n$: The space of all n-dimensional real vectors
- Matrices of a size m x n

## Subspace

A Subspace is itself a vector space that is inside of a vector space. A subset S $\subseteq$ V is a subspace if: 
- if u,v $\in$ S, then u + v $\in$ S
- if v $\in$ S and c is a scalar then cV $\in$ S
- There exists a 0 vector such that v + 0 $\in$ S

Examples of a subspace are usually:
- The column space of a matrix is a subspace of $R^m$
- The null space of a matrix is a subspace of $R^n$

## Column Space (Range)

The column space or Range of a matrix is the subspace of $R^m$ spanned by the columns of the matrix A. I represents all the possible linear combinations of the columns of A. 

For example

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 &...& a_n \end{bmatrix}$$
then the column space of A is

$$Col(A) = span({a_1,a_2,...,a_n})$$
So the Column Space of A is all vectors b $\in$ $R^m$ such that:

$$Ax =b$$
## Null Space

Say for a linear regression our goal is Ax = b however, we arrive at Ax= 0 this set of vector of x such that Ax = 0 belonging to x $\in$ $R^n$ is defined as the **Null Space** of A.

$$Null(A) = ( x \in R^n : Ax = 0)$$
The **Null Space** is also considered to be a subspace of $R^n$

If you have more rows than columns than you will have more variables than equations to solve so you will have vectors in the null space

## Span

The span of a set of vectors is defined to be the **all** the linear combinations of the given set of vectors. It represents the space generated by the vectors

- Span of vectors is the same as the column space of vectors. 
- The span of 2 linearly independent vectors in $R^3$ forms a plane ( a 2D subspace)

$$
span(v_1,v_2,..v_n) = (c_1v_1+c_2v_2+...+c_nv_n | c_1,c_2...c_n \in R)
$$
## Basis

The smallest possible set of vectors that spans the space. If you remove a vector from a basis, it no longer spans the space

So a basis is also a vector space like the span but it must satisfy the following: All vectors
- Must be linearly independent (no vector)
- Span the vector space (every vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors)

Dimension from the Basis

- The number of basis vectors is the dimension of the vector space since it represents the number of linearly independent vectors that spans the space. 
- Every matrix has a basis
- The Basis isn't unique
- The number of vectors in a basis for a given subspace is always the same
- The number is the dimension of the subspace

## Orthogonal Space

The orthogonal space is the set of vectors that are perpendicular to it according to the standard dot product. 

S if v $\in$ V, w $\in$ W and $v^Tw=0$ then the subspace V and W are orthogonal to each other or $V^TW=0$

Both subspaces belong to the same subspace $R^n$ if V $\in$ $R^n$
## Matrix Rank

The **Rank** of a matrix is the Largest # of linearly independent rows/columns in a matrix. 

Also, can be defined as the # of vectors in a basis for the column space of A. An important property is as follows:

$rowRank(A)=ColRank(A)=Rank(A)$

## Connecting the Spaces Together

From a geometric perspective it is important to see how a 4 of these subspaces are connected together. 

The $Col(A)$ is a subspace of $R^m$ that satisfies $Ax=b$, representing all the possible linear combinations of the columns. The dimensions of this is determined by the rank(A). 

Orthogonal to the $Col(A)$ is the Left Null Space of A. This lives in the subspace $R^m$ and has dimensions equal to m - r. This is also the Null Space of $A^T$. Satisfies $A^Ty=0$ (All y orthogonal to the $Col(A)$)

The row(A) is a subspace of $R^n$ and the rank of it is the same as the rank of the matrix. This is the space spanned by the rows of A. It satisfies the equation $A^Tr=b$ (the constraints imposed on x)


Orthogonal to the row(A) in the subspace of $R^n$ is the null Space of A. The $Null(A)$ is orthogonal to $row(A)$. The $Null(A)$ satisfies $Ax=0$
