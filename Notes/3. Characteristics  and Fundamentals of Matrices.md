hBefore getting into the in-depth study of different matrices, it is important to look into and understand the different concepts related to the properties of a matrix.

## Vector Space

The vector space of a matrix consists of all vectors obtained from matrix-vector multiplications and the existence of a zero vector.

For a set $V$ to be a vector space, the following must hold true:
- If $u, v \in V$, then $u + v \in V$
- If $v \in V$ and $c$ is a scalar, then $cV \in V$
- There exists a zero vector such that $v + 0 = v$

Typical examples of a vector space are:
- $\mathbb{R}^n$: The space of all $n$-dimensional real vectors.
- Matrices of size $m \times n$.

## Subspace

A subspace is itself a vector space that is inside of a vector space. A subset $S \subseteq V$ is a subspace if:
- If $u, v \in S$, then $u + v \in S$
- If $v \in S$ and $c$ is a scalar, then $cV \in S$
- There exists a zero vector such that $v + 0 = v$

Examples of a subspace are:
- The column space of a matrix is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$.
- The null space of a matrix is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Column Space (Range)

The column space (or range) of a matrix is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ spanned by the columns of the matrix $A$. It represents all the possible linear combinations of the columns of $A$.

For example:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \dots & a_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

The column space of $A$ is:

$$
\text{Col}(A) = \text{span}({a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n})
$$

So the column space of $A$ is all vectors $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that:

$$
Ax = b
$$

## Null Space

For a linear system, if $Ax = b$, but we instead have $Ax = 0$, the set of vectors $x$ such that $Ax = 0$ (with $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$) is defined as the **Null Space** of $A$:

$$
\text{Null}(A) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : Ax = 0 \}
$$

The null space is also considered a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

If you have more rows than columns, then you will have more variables than equations to solve, so you will have vectors in the null space.

---

## Span

The span of a set of vectors is defined to be **all** the linear combinations of the given set of vectors. It represents the space generated by the vectors.

- The span of vectors is the same as the column space of the vectors.
- The span of 2 linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ forms a plane (a 2D subspace).

$$
\text{span}(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n) = \{c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \dots + c_nv_n \mid c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

---

## Basis

The smallest possible set of vectors that spans the space is called the **basis**. If you remove a vector from the basis, it no longer spans the space.

For a basis:
- All vectors must be **linearly independent**.
- The basis must span the vector space (every vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors).

### Dimension from the Basis:
- The number of basis vectors is the **dimension** of the vector space, representing the number of linearly independent vectors that span the space.
- Every matrix has a basis.
- The basis is not unique.
- The number of vectors in a basis for a given subspace is always the same.
- The number is the dimension of the subspace.

---

## Orthogonal Space

The orthogonal space is the set of vectors that are perpendicular to it according to the standard dot product.

If $v \in V$ and $w \in W$, and $v^T w = 0$, then the subspaces $V$ and $W$ are orthogonal to each other, or:

$$
V^T W = 0
$$

Both subspaces belong to the same vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ if $V \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

---

## Matrix Rank

The **rank** of a matrix is the largest number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix. It can also be defined as the number of vectors in a basis for the column space of $A$.

An important property is:

$$
\text{RowRank}(A) = \text{ColRank}(A) = \text{Rank}(A)
$$

---

## Example: Matrix Properties

Let:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

#### Row Reduction:
The row-reduced form of $A$:

$$
R = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

#### Rank and Nullity:
- **Rank**: Number of non-zero rows in $R$:

$$
\text{rank}(A) = 2
$$

- **Nullity**:

$$
\text{nullity}(A) = \text{number of columns} - \text{rank} = 3 - 2 = 1
$$

---

#### Null Space:
Solve $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$:
1. **Equations**:

$$
x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0, \quad x_2 + 2x_3 = 0.
$$

2. **Solution**:

$$
\mathbf{x} = x_3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

- **Null Space**:

$$
\text{Null}(A) = \text{span}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right).
$$

## Connecting the Spaces Together

The $Col(A)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ that satisfies $Ax = b$, representing all possible linear combinations of the columns. The dimension of this is determined by $\text{rank}(A)$.

Orthogonal to $Col(A)$ is the Left Null Space of $A$, which satisfies $A^T y = 0$.

The $Row(A)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and satisfies $A^T r = b$. Orthogonal to $Row(A)$ is the $Null(A)$, which satisfies $Ax = 0$.
